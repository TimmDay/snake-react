## Snake vs the Fizz Buzz

[Here](https://fizz-buzz-snake.herokuapp.com/) :arrow_left: play the game!


The first thing that I ever did on the internet was play the snake game on the nokia website. Many years later, I wanted to play with html5 canvas and javascript/react... so here we are!

(it is desktop only, if anyone knows a quick way to map mobile screen taps to desktop arrow keys please let me know).

If you want to jump straight into the game code and tinker, here's a [pen](https://codepen.io/TimDay88/pen/JzLKRQ?editors=1010)

Build with react/redux, sass, express, node and heroku. The fizz buzz logic can be found in the component SideBarLeft.js
